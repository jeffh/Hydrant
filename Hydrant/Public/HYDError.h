@protocol HYDMapper;
@protocol HYDAccessor;

/*! The NSError subclass object that all hydrant mappers emit.
 *
 *  Unlike normal NSErrors, mappers can do one of the following:
 *
 *  - Return nil, indicating no errors parsing the source object.
 *  - Return a non-fatal error, indicating some fallback strategy was used
 *    when parsing the source object.
 *  - Return a fatal error, indicating the source object could not be parsed.
 *
 *  The safest way to determine if a mapper's result is safe to use is to use
 *  the -[HYDError isFatal] method. Or read it from the user info, userInfo[HYDIsFatalKey].
 *
 *  In addition, HYDErrors may contain multiple errors. Use -[underlyingErrors] to
 *  get all the errors (or HYDUnderlyingErrors key). For convenience, there is
 *  an -[underlyingFatalErrors] to quickly fetch fatal errors that occurred.
 *
 *  Since mappers can be arbitrarily nested, HYDErrors can too. And it is not safe
 *  to assume the tree of errors are always HYDErrors. For example, NSFormatter-based,
 *  mappers will also store the original NSFormatter errors inside a HYDError.
 *
 *  A small set of helper constructors are provided for when you build your own mappers
 *  to allow you to capture and handle errors that bubble up from child mappers.
 *
 *  Codes that HYDError can return are:
 *
 *  - HYDErrorInvalidSourceObjectValue to indicate the source object was invalid
 *  - HYDErrorInvalidSourceObjectType to indicate the source object's type was incorrect
 *  - HYDErrorInvalidResultingObjectType to indicate the resulting object produced was an invalid type
 *  - HYDErrorMultipleErrors to indicate multiple parsing errors have occurred
 *
 *  For performance reasons, HYDErrors lazily generate their userInfo since the majority
 *  of the time errors are unaccessed when generated from child mappers.

@interface HYDError : NSError

/*! Constructs a new HYDError to report a mapping error occurred.
 *
 *  Every parameter, but code and isFatal are optional. Although the more information you
 *  provide will help other developers diagnose parse errors.
 *
 *  @param code The NSError code that this error represents. Please use one of the Hydrant error codes.
 *  @param sourceObject the source object that produced this mapping error. Return nil if not known.
 *  @param sourceAccessor the origin property/key that this source object originated from. Return nil if not known.
 *  @param destinationAccessor the target property/key that this resulting object would be store in. Return nil if not known.
 *  @param isFatal the bool that indicates if this error is fatal. It is still the mapper's responsibility to
 *                 return a nil resulting object if the error was fatal.
 *  @param underlyingErrors An error of any kind of NSErrors that contributed to this error. Return nil if there
 *                          are no underlying errors.
 *  @returns a new HYDError instance
